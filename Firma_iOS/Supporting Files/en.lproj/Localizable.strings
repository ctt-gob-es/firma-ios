"faq_answer_three" = "Certificates are stored on your device with a powerful password-protected encryption, but like any encrypted system, the moment it is out of the owner's control it runs the risk of being compromised. If you lose the device, you should contact your certification service provider as soon as possible to immediately revoke the certificates it contained.";
